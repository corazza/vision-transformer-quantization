# Computationally Efficient Visual Transformers (Visage Technologies internship)

We implemented quantization methods for visual transformers and analyzed tradeoffs between model performance and accuracy (Visage Technologies internship)

To reproduce results, consult the `scripts/` directory.
The general workflow is:
1. Finetune the models (`start_finetune.sh small finetune-small` etc.)
2. Run the experiments (`start_experiments.sh`)
